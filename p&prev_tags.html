    <p>About JNV Davanagere
        The 2001 was the most auspicious year when the foundation stone of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Devarahalli, Davangere was laid down. The school campus covers around 25 acres of land. These buildings include the  modern state of art infrastructure and the newly-refurbished student hostels and staff houses. The academic buildings including several classrooms are linked by a computer network. The widespread use of email and an intranet system shrinks the distances and keeps staff, students and administration in quick and easy contact with one another. The Vidyalaya is very near to National Highway and State highway which provide good transport facility to all.</p>
